# Usage Guide - Workout Timers Mobile

## 1) Enable the plugin
1. Open Obsidian.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Community plugins`.
3. Disable `Restricted mode` (if enabled).
4. Open `Installed plugins` and enable `Workout Timers Mobile`.

## 2) Insert timers in a note
In your workout note, add this block:

```workout-timers
Mobility
Activation
Block 1
Block 2
```

Each line creates an independent timer.

## 3) Use during training
- `Start`: starts the timer for that section.
- `Stop`: pauses the timer for that section.
- `Reset`: resets that section to zero.

Note: only one timer can be active at a time. If you start another, the previous one stops automatically.

## 4) Where data is stored
Times are stored in plugin data (they persist when Obsidian is closed and reopened).
